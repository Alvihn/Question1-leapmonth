# Question1-leapmonth
This program uses a Scanner object to read the user's input and store it in the month variable. Then, it uses the leap month condition to check if the input month is a leap month or not. If it is, it prints a message indicating that it is a leap month; otherwise, it prints a message indicating that it is not a leap month.
